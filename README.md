User-Management-Fullstack-App

This full-stack application is designed for user management, incorporating both backend and frontend implementations. The backend is built using Node.js and MySQL, handling user registration, authentication (with JWT), and CRUD operations. The frontend is developed with React, providing a responsive UI for user registration, login, and management functionalities, all protected by JWT. The application ensures secure password hashing and maintains robust authentication practices.
